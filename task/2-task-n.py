#  Try the `n` parameter with different models (`deployment_name`). With the parameter `n`, we can configure how many
#       chat completion choices to generate for each input message
#  User massage: Why is the snow white?

# Models to try:
# - gpt-4o
# - claude-3-7-sonnet@20250219

# If you have worked with ChatGPT, you have probably seen responses where ChatGPT offers you a choice between two
# responses to select which one you prefer. This is done with the `n` parameter.
